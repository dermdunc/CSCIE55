Solution:

The solution includes a single class - Elevator - which uses arrays to track the number
of passengers in an elevator and whether a stop is required at each floor along with
the number of passengers who will get off at a particular floor.
The elevator moves up or down floor by floor and changes direction if it reaches either
the top or bottom floors.

Assumptions:

1. Elevator is only stopped to let passengers off, none are taken on.
2. Elevator stops sequentially at each floor even if no stop is required
by a passenger on that floor.


Classes:

Elevator 	 : The base elevator class that tracks passengers.
ElevatorTest : A class Test which creates an Elevator object, boards two passengers
               for the 3nd floor, and one for the 5th floor. Then moves the Elevator from the ground
               floor to the top floor, and then back to the ground floor.
